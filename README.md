# TAB-Hotkeys
hotkeys for TAB

Currently working for 1080 x 1920 in borderless windowed full sreen mode. 

Run with AutoHotKey, can be downloaded here https://www.autohotkey.com/

Default hotkeys are "q,w,e,r,a,s,d,f,z,x,c,v" for positions 1-12 on the command center. 

Refer to https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm if you want to change the default hot keys used.

This script only works while in the command center menu. It tries to detect the command center by checking the color oa pixel on the HUD where the command center should be. If the script isn't working, try pressing F11 with TAB open and with the command center selected. An alert box will pop up with the detected color. Go into the .ahk file and replace the color on the first line with the color in alert box.

Soldier/Engineering center support comming soon...maybe
